\usage{
cw_greplv(pattern, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE, fixed = FALSE,
  useBytes = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{character string containing a \link{regular expression}
    (or character string for \code{fixed = TRUE}) to be matched
    in the given character vector.  Coerced by
    \code{\link{as.character}} to a character string if possible.  If a
    character vector of length 2 or more is supplied, the first element
    is used with a warning.  Missing values are allowed except for
    \code{regexpr} and \code{gregexpr}.}

\item{x}{a character vector where matches are sought, or an
    object which can be coerced by \code{as.character} to a character
    vector.  \link{Long vectors} are supported.}

\item{ignore.case}{if \code{FALSE}, the pattern matching is \emph{case
      sensitive} and if \code{TRUE}, case is ignored during matching.}

\item{perl}{logical.  Should Perl-compatible regexps be used?}

\item{fixed}{logical.  If \code{TRUE}, \code{pattern} is a string to be
    matched as is.  Overrides all conflicting arguments.}

\item{useBytes}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the matching is done
    byte-by-byte rather than character-by-character.  See
    \sQuote{Details}.}
